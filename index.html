        <h3>Technical Program Management</h3>
        <p>In this role I manage multiple areas at the same time and typically focused on technical projects or tech aspects of product deliveries. Successes here draw heavily from my technical background and project management skills to manage
          programs of work. Success benefits from my breadth of interdisciplinary skills & process familiarity. Cross-functional understanding and people skills help me coordinate projects across many teams with underpinning interest in technical
          project(s). Core competencies include understanding and traversing technical dependencies while working very closely with technical people and at the same time managing the roadmap/plan and communicating widely (often non-technical
          stakeholders) to ensure teams are on-track.</p>

        <h3>Agile Management</h3>
        <p>In this role I've managed collaborated cross-functionally with full range of functional teams and stakeholders for high quality and timely website development using various manifestations of the principles of Agile software development.
          Particularly in traditional Scrum and hybrids of Scrum, Kanban, and Project frameworks for Product development and delivery.</p>

        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to build websites using tools like WordPress to build personal and business blogs. Working with engineers in my day job (Technical Program Management), I learned to write code for a deeper and more technical
          understanding of what it took to implement the requirements and scope I managed day-to-day. Each day I added to my competence and experience designing and developing web applications and have gained a good deal of experience designing and
          developing web applications.</p>
